// Example: Emit booking event when booking is created
let booking_event = event_manager.emit_booking_event(
    booking_id,
    user_address,
    provider_address,
    service_id,
    booking_amount,
    1, // event_subtype: created
    booking_metadata
);
```

### Payment Contract Integration
```cairo
// Example: Emit payment event when payment is completed
let payment_event = event_manager.emit_payment_event(
    789, // payment_id
    user_address,
    provider_address,
    Uint256(5000, 0), // amount

    event_type: felt252,
    source_contract: ContractAddress,
    user_address: ContractAddress,
    timestamp: felt252
) {}
```

### Subscription Events
```cairo
@event
func SubscriptionCreated(

## Usage Examples

### 1. Emitting Platform Events
```cairo
// Emit booking created event
let booking_event = event_manager.emit_booking_event(
    123, // booking_id
    user_address,
    provider_address,
    456, // service_id
    Uint256(1000, 0), // amount
    1, // event_subtype: created
    1 // metadata
);

// Emit payment completed event
let payment_event = event_manager.emit_payment_event(
    789, // payment_id
    user_address,
    provider_address,
    Uint256(5000, 0), // amount
    token_address,
    2, // event_subtype: completed
    2 // metadata
);
```

### 2. Creating Subscriptions
```cairo
// Subscribe to booking events
let event_types = array![
    EVENT_TYPE_BOOKING_CREATED,
    EVENT_TYPE_BOOKING_CONFIRMED,
    EVENT_TYPE_BOOKING_COMPLETED
];

let subscription_id = event_manager.subscribe_to_events(
    SUBSCRIPTION_TYPE_BOOKING,
    event_types
);
```

### 3. Event Batching
```cairo
// Create event batch
let batch_id = event_manager.create_event_batch();

// Add events to batch
event_manager.add_event_to_batch(batch_id, event_id_1);
event_manager.add_event_to_batch(batch_id, event_id_2);
event_manager.add_event_to_batch(batch_id, event_id_3);

// Process batch
event_manager.process_event_batch(batch_id);
```

### 4. Custom Events
```cairo
// Create custom event type
let custom_event_type_id = event_manager.create_custom_event_type(
    12345, // name
    67890, // description
    11111, // data_schema
    PRIORITY_MEDIUM // priority_default
);

// Emit custom event
let custom_event = event_manager.emit_custom_event(
    custom_event_type_id,
    user_address,
    99999, // data_hash
    PRIORITY_HIGH, // priority
    55555 // metadata
);
```

## Gas Optimization Strategies

### Event Batching
- **Batch Creation**: Group multiple events into a single batch
- **Priority Processing**: Process high-priority events first
- **Batch Size Limits**: Control batch size for optimal gas usage
- **Processing Efficiency**: Process batches in single transactions

### Storage Optimization
- **Minimal Metadata**: Store only essential event data
- **Efficient Indexing**: Optimized storage for quick retrieval
- **Data Compression**: Compress event data where possible
- **Cleanup Mechanisms**: Remove old events to save storage

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- **Authorized Contracts**: Only authorized contracts can emit events
- **Admin Controls**: Critical functions restricted to admin
- **Subscription Security**: Only subscribers can manage their subscriptions

### Data Integrity
- **Immutable Events**: All events are permanently recorded
- **Timestamp Validation**: All events include block timestamps
- **Event Verification**: Events can be verified against source contracts

## Off-chain Integration

### Event Parsing
Events are structured for easy parsing by off-chain services:
- **Consistent Format**: Standardized event structure
- **Metadata Support**: Extensible metadata system
- **Priority Information**: Priority levels for notification systems
- **Source Tracking**: Track which contract emitted each event

### Notification Services
The contract supports integration with:
- **Email Services**: Priority-based email notifications
- **Push Notifications**: Real-time mobile notifications
- **Webhook Systems**: HTTP callbacks for events
- **Analytics Platforms**: Event data for analytics

## Testing

The contract includes comprehensive test coverage:
- Event emission for all event types
- Subscription creation and management
- Event batching and processing
- Custom event type creation
- Event history and filtering
- Event metadata management
- Module integration testing

## Deployment

### Constructor
```cairo
@constructor
func constructor(admin_address: ContractAddress)
```

### Authorization
```cairo
@external
func authorize_contract(contract_address: ContractAddress)
```

Authorize other contracts to emit events.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Filtering**: Complex event filtering rules
2. **Event Encryption**: Encrypted events for sensitive data
3. **Event Replay**: Event replay capabilities for debugging
4. **Cross-chain Events**: Events for cross-chain operations
5. **Event Analytics**: Built-in event analytics and reporting

## Conclusion

The EventManager contract provides a robust foundation for real-time event emission and notification systems. Its comprehensive event coverage, efficient gas optimization, and flexible subscription system make it ideal for integrating with off-chain notification services while maintaining platform performance and security.
